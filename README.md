# Neo4j playground

This is a sample application using a Neo4j database (graph database). The application will model a social media site, as I see from online resources that it is a common use case for this type of database.

The whole point of this is for me to become familiar with this type of database.

The basic structure of the project is:
- Neo4j as the database
- a REST API written in Java with Spring;
  - will try to use both Cypher requests and SDN (which is an Object Graph Model - OGM; correspondent of ORM in graph model)
- TBD: some static files with HTMX for the front-end (at least for now); have to look into tailwind for CSS
- TBD: Docker Swarm
